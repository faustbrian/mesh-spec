/**
 * Exception thrown when requested relationships are not permitted for resource inclusion.

 * against unauthorized data access and N+1 query issues from unrestricted includes.
 *
 * Results in HTTP 422 status with details about which relationships are invalid and
 * which relationships are permitted (or if none are available).
